	<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
	<p>Shuangpin(雙拼; 双拼) input method is a Chinese character input method that splits each phonetic syllable into initial consonant and final vowel, and combines them into a single key. Thus, the user can type a Chinese character by hitting only two keys that are possible. </p>
	<p>The key of Shuangpin input method is divided into two parts, which are initial key and final key. </p>
	<p>In the initial key, the initial consonant that is the same as the English letter is directly represented by the English letter, like the initial consonant "b" is represented by the letter B. If the initial consonant is different from the English letters, they are represented by English letters that do not have the same initial consonants. In the figure below, the initial consonants “zh, ch, sh” in green are replaced by the corresponding English letters V, I, U.</p>
	<p>In the final key, different English letters are used to represent different final vowels. In the figure below, the final vowels "iu, ia" in gray are represented by the corresponding English letters Q and W.</p>

	<h3 id="scheme">The keyway scheme of Shuangpin input method</h3>
	<p>There are seven common key schemes for Shuangpin input method. In most Shuangpin layout schemes, such as FlyPy, Microsoft, and Ziranma, final vowels with the highest frequency are placed in the middle layer to reduce the risk of repeated strain.</p>

	<h3 id="method">Usage method</h3>
	<p>Take Microsoft Shuangpin for example, to type in "<span class="high">中</span>（Pinyin: <span class="high">zhong</span>）”, simply press the "<span class="high">V</span>" key (representing the initial consonant "<span class="high">zh</span>") and then press the "<span class="high">S</span>" key (representing the final vowel "<span class="high">ong</span>"); to type in “<span class="high">文</span> (Pinyin: <span class="high">wen</span>)”, simply press the "<span class="high">W</span>" key (representing the initial consonant "<span class="high">w</span>") and then press the "<span class="high">F</span>" key (representing the final vowel "<span class="high">en</span>"). So input "<span class="high">中文</span>", we only need to input "<span class="high">VSWF</span>" in Shuangpin, not the full pinyin of "<span class="high">ZHONGWEN</span>".</p>
	<img src="Microsoft_Shuangpin.png" alt="Microsoft Shuangpin">
	<p>We can find that many keys correspond to more than one final vowel. For example, the “<span class="high">W</span>” key corresponds to the final vowels “<span class="high">ia</span>” and “<span class="high">ua</span>”, and the “<span class="high">S</span>” key corresponds to the final vowels “<span class="high">iong</span>” and “<span class="high">ong</span>”. But when these final vowels are used, there is no ambiguity. Because these final vowels represented by the same key do not form a Chinese character with the same initial consonant. For example, there is “<span class="high">花</span>”（Pinyin: <span class="high">hua</span>）, but there is no Chinese character for “<span class="high">hia</span>” with pinyin. Another example is "<span class="high">兄</span>" (Pinyin: <span class="high">xiong</span>), but there is no “<span class="high">xong</span>”.</p>

	<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>		
	<ol>
		<li><span class="highlight">Fast Input Speed</span>: Compared with Full Pinyin input method, Shuangpin input method only needs two keys to input a Chinese character, which improves the input speed.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Easy to Learn</span>: Each key of Shuangpin corresponds to a fixed initial consonant and final vowel. Therefore, as long as memorize the initial consonants and final vowels corresponding to the keyboard, we can easily master the Shuangpin.</li>
