	<h3> IBM phonetic keyboard </h3>

	    <img src="Xu's phonetic keyboard.png" width="800px" alt="Xu's phonetic keyboard" title="Xu's phonetic keyboard">
	</a>
	<h3> Xu's phonetic keyboard </h3>
	<p>The inventor is Prof. 
	<script>
		var str="Xu Wenlian"
	document.write (str.link("https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A8%B1%E8%81%9E%E5%BB%89"));
	</script> 
	. The "Xu's keyboard" only uses 25 keys, and the "Q" key is reserved for switching input. The arrangement of the "Xu's Keyboard" is suitable for those who are familiar with the English keyboard, and it is also easy to realize touch typing.</p>

	</a>
	<h3>  Phone number keyboard </h3>
	<p>Due to the large number of mobile phone manufacturers, the corresponding versions of the mobile phone number keyboard will be slightly different.</p>
	<br/>
	<hr/>

	<h3 id="method">Usage method</h3>
	<p>The phonetic notation for "中文" is "ㄓㄨㄥ ㄨㄣˊ". Take the Daqian phonetic input keyboard as an example, to input "中 (Pinyin: zhong)", you need to press the "5" key to represent "ㄓ", the "J" key" to represent "ㄨ", /" to represent "ㄥ", "space key " to represent "first tone"; input "文 (Pinyin: wen)", you need to press "J" key to represent "ㄨ", "P" key to represent "ㄣ", "6" key to represent "second sound" ( ˊ). So to input “中文”, we need to input “5J space bar JP6” in the phonetic input method.</p>

	<p>For those who are familiar with Zhuyin, the Zhuyin input method can be used easily whether typing traditional or simplified characters. But for people who don't know Zhuyin, it's difficult.</p>
	<p class="firstpart">It is not recommended for people who do not know phonetic symbols.(Only the author's own point of view)</p>

	<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>		
	<ol>
		<li>The Phonetic input method is easy for Taiwanese to get started. Almost everyone in Taiwan knows the phonetic symbols and can use them without special study.</li>
		<li>Compared with the Chinese Pinyin input method, the Phonetic input method can usually type out the sound of a word without following the pronunciation order, and has the function of quick replacement of phonetic symbols, finals, and tones, and usually supports parallel input.</li>
