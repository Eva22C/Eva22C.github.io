	<h1>Cangjie Input Method（仓颉输入法）</h1>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>After returning to Taiwan in 1973, Zhu Fengfu began to improve Chinese typewriters and research Chinese retrieval methods. After three years of research, he published the "Shape Contour Coding Method" in 1976, using 52 Chinese characters as search letters, and dividing each Chinese character into three letters for coding.</p>
	<p>In 1978, Zhu and his assistant Shen Honglian rewrote the stemming method, reducing the number of searched letters from 52 to 26 to fit on an ordinary computer keyboard. In 1979, he successfully implemented a Chinese communication system using Chinese characters as internal codes.</p>
	<p>He continued to refine the shape contour encoding method and in 1979 founded Zero One to develop the second generation method. In 1982, he selected 40,000 characters from the "Kangxi Dictionary", improved the second generation, and published it as the third generation.</p>
	<p>At present, font coding is the most widely used traditional Chinese character input method. The repetition rate is low and the font library is large. However, due to the emphasis on Chinese character retrieval, a complete "axis system" that Zhu Chu thought could solve the six major problems of Chinese characters has not been fully realized.</p><br/>

	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
	<li>Cangjie relies on a set of 24 basic keystrokes that correspond to various character components, such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, and curves.</li>
	<li>The method assigns a unique code to each Chinese character based on its structure, allowing users to input characters quickly and accurately.</li>
	<li>It supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, but it is primarily used for Traditional Chinese characters.</li>

	<h2 id="usage method">Usage method</h2>
	<img src="Picture3.png" alt="Picture3" title="Picture3 scheme">
	<p>Instead of typing phonetics like Pinyin, users type the shapes of the characters. Each key on the keyboard represents a basic shape or stroke, and characters are input by combining these shapes.</p>
	<p>To use Cangjie, you need to learn the 24 basic Cangjie radicals and their corresponding keys. For example:</p>

	<ol type="A"> 
		<li>日 (sun)</li>
		<li>月 (moon)</li>
		<li>金 (metal)</li>
		<li>木 (wood)</li>
		<li>水 (water)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>To type a character, break it down into its radicals and type the corresponding keys. For instance, to input "明" (meaning bright), you would type "AB" since it consists of the radicals 日 (A) and 月 (B).</p>

	<h2 id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2>
	<p3>Advantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>High accuracy: Due to the unique code assigned to each character, the Cangjie Input Method offers high accuracy and reduces the likelihood of mistyping.</li>
		<li>Speed: Once users become proficient, they can type quickly and efficiently.</li>
		<li>Learning tool: Learning the Cangjie Input Method can help users better understand the structure and composition of Chinese characters.</li>
	</ol>
	<br/>

	<p3>Disadvantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Steep learning curve: The Cangjie Input Method requires users to learn and memorize a significant number of codes, making it challenging for beginners.</li>
		<li>Limited use: Although it supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, the Cangjie Input Method's primary user base is in regions that use Traditional Chinese characters, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong.</li>
