	<h1>Cangjie Input Method（仓颉输入法）</h1>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>In 1973, after returning to Taiwan, Chu Bong-Foo began to improve the Chinese typewriter and studied Chinese retrieval methods. After three years of research, he released the "Shape-Contour Coding Method" in 1976, which used 52 Chinese letters as search letters and divided each Chinese character into three letters for coding.</p>
	<p>In 1978, Chu and his assistant Shen Honglian re-planned the method of extracting word roots, reducing the search letters from 52 to 26 to adapt to the general computer keyboard. In 1979, he successfully implemented the Chinese communication system using Chinese letters as internal codes.</p>
	<p>He continued to improve the Shape-Contour Coding Method and established the Zero-One Company to develop the second generation of the method in 1979. In 1982, he selected over 40,000 words from the Kangxi Dictionary to improve the second generation and published it as the third generation of the method.</p>
	<p>Today, the Shape-Contour Coding Method is the most widely used input method for traditional Chinese characters. It has a low repetition rate and a large character library. However, Chu's original idea of a complete "Shape-Contour System" that would handle the six major problems of Chinese characters was not fully realized due to the focus on Chinese character retrieval.</p><br/>

	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
	<li>Cangjie relies on a set of 24 basic keystrokes that correspond to various character components, such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, and curves.</li>
	<li>The method assigns a unique code to each Chinese character based on its structure, allowing users to input characters quickly and accurately.</li>
	<li>It supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, but it is primarily used for Traditional Chinese characters.</li>

	<hr/>
	<h2 id="usage method">Usage method</h2>
	<img src="Picture3.png" alt="Picture3" title="Picture3 scheme">
	<p>Instead of typing phonetics like Pinyin, users type the shapes of the characters. Each key on the keyboard represents a basic shape or stroke, and characters are input by combining these shapes.</p>
	<p>To use Cangjie, you need to learn the 24 basic Cangjie radicals and their corresponding keys. For example:</p>

	<ol type="A"> 
		<li>日 (sun)</li>
		<li>月 (moon)</li>
		<li>金 (metal)</li>
		<li>木 (wood)</li>
		<li>水 (water)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>To type a character, break it down into its radicals and type the corresponding keys. For instance, to input "明" (meaning bright), you would type "AB" since it consists of the radicals 日 (A) and 月 (B).</p>

	<h2 id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2>
	<p3>Advantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>High accuracy: Due to the unique code assigned to each character, the Cangjie Input Method offers high accuracy and reduces the likelihood of mistyping.</li>
		<li>Speed: Once users become proficient, they can type quickly and efficiently.</li>
		<li>Learning tool: Learning the Cangjie Input Method can help users better understand the structure and composition of Chinese characters.</li>
	</ol>
	<br/>

	<p3>Disadvantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Steep learning curve: The Cangjie Input Method requires users to learn and memorize a significant number of codes, making it challenging for beginners.</li>
		<li>Limited use: Although it supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, the Cangjie Input Method's primary user base is in regions that use Traditional Chinese characters, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong.</li>
