  <h2>Here's what we found while experimenting with different input methods:</h2>
  <h3>AN Ziyue</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Though this project, I found that there are different kinds of keyboard layout for different language. For Latin alphabet input, QWERTY keyboard layout is the basement, new approaches have developed it from the point of view of efficiency, ergonomics and learning costs. Keyboard designs that extremely pursuing efficiency and ergonomics may not be widely used as learning a new typing method causes a large learning cost. Take me for instance, I am used to the QWERTY method, so I don't have much incentive to learn new methods.</li>
    <li>Voice input allows more people to communicate via electronic devices, it is friendly to old people. And it is a convenient method when you are busy as voice input is efficient.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> CAO Ziyan</h3>
  <p>Due to the similarities between Full pinyin and Shuangpin input methods, here are some findings based on research and practical experience to compare them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Input Speed: Only two keys are needed for each Chinese character in Shuagpin input method. So with practice, it can achieve very high input speed. However, for users who are already proficient in Full Pinyin, it may be difficult for them to quickly switch to Shuangpin. In my experience, Shuangpin works better for certain types of characters, such as those that require more than two keystrokes to fully spell.</li>
    <li>Learning Efficiency: Based on the learning process of myself and my friends in Hong Kong who have not learned pinyin, I found that those who have learned pinyin are much easier to learn, because the correspondence between letters and initial consonant and final vowel is intuitive to those who have learned pinyin. Full Pinyin input method requires users to memorize the full spelling of each Chinese character individually, which is difficult for some Chinese pinyin beginners. So for beginners of Chinese pinyin, the use of Shuangpin input method may also be an effective method.</li>
    <li>Error Rate: The error rate of Shuangpin is lower than that of Full Pinyin, because Full Pinyin sometimes requires more than two letters to enter a Chinese character, which is easy to type wrong. For example, if we type “双“(Chinese Pinyin: Shuang）, the type is faster, it may become "Shaung" or "Shusng".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a native Chinese speaker who is familiar with pinyin and likes to type quickly, I prefer Full Pinyin input method. My friends who are not familiar with Chinese pinyin, including Chinese beginners, tend to choose Shuangpin.</p>

  <h3>LIN Zerong</h3>
  <p>The experience of Cangjie input method and fast input method: These two input methods use strokes to input the characters we need, but compared with the Pinyin input method, they are both far behind. We have summarized the following points:  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cangjie and fast input methods have a small audience and slow development. The earliest Cangjie was born in Taiwan, but now only Hong Kong and Macau are using it, and Taiwan is gradually turning to the Pinyin input method. However, due to the lack of Pinyin in Mandarin, Hong Kong people are forced to use Cangjie. The pinyin input method can type out phrases, make associations, and record users' habits to generate keywords, but the Cangjie input method is stuck in place and does not make progress. </li>
    <li>It is very difficult for Cangjie to decompose characters and codes. In addition, the complexity of traditional characters has resulted in many characters that cannot be separated and input. Such as “冎” need to be “月月”, it is difficult to understand.</li>
    <li>Compared with Wubi, the keyboards of Cangjie and fast input methods are less user-friendly. Wubi’s keyboards are designed according to typing speed and comfort, but Cangjie’s "日月金木水火土" correspond to "ABCDEFG" respectively. kind of like a gimmick or something. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Of course, Cangjie and Express input methods are also very good input methods after being proficient, but with the change of people's daily usage habits, Cangjie input method has gradually become less popular.</p>


  <h3>YANG Keyan</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>For the Wubi input method, firstly, the user needs to know the Wubi radical table proficiently so that it can be conveniently used. It is difficult to get started. Once you get started, you can easily input as long as you know the shape of the characters, which is suitable for inputting rare characters. And the Chinese characters are unique, unlike pinyin, which is easy to confuse, so the Wubi input method is also suitable for people who are not good at pinyin.

    <ul>
      <li>In the process of experience, Wubi input method will be more efficient than the Full pinyin input method. However, in real life, people who generally use the Full pinyin input method can easily switch to the Shuangpin input method. Compared with the Shuangpin input method, the Wubi input method no longer has an advantage in terms of input efficiency.</li>

      <li>In addition, the three versions of the Wubi input method all have the mode of mixing Wubi and pinyin, so it can also be used when the user only knows the pronunciation but not the shape of the font. Moreover, it is unexpectedly found that the QWERTY mode commonly used by the public does not conform to the ergonomics theory, and the position of the frequently used keys is not reasonable. For example, the practical frequency of the E key is the highest but deviates from the starting position of the finger. This causes the user's efficiency to be reduced. The Wubi input method has avoided this problem. Furthermore, the repetition rate is not the lower, the better. The input method also needs to consider the coordination and regularity of use. Wubi input method cleverly takes these problems into consideration.</li>

      <li>Finally, from a cultural point of view, Wubi Input Method is a great invention that integrates Chinese characters into modern life. Chinese characters are based on shape, and most Chinese characters are pictophonetic characters. Due to the development of modern computers, Pinyin has been used extensively, while Chinese characters have gradually been forgotten. The emergence of the Wubi input method is a kind of rescue of the cultural inheritance of Chinese characters today. The use of the Wubi input method can reduce the problem of forgetting characters when picking up a pen.</li>
    </ul>

    Judging from the above findings, the Wubi input method is a great invention of science. It is a pity that due to the high degree of difficulty of entry, the number of people using it is gradually decreasing.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>For the Phonetic input method,  because it needs to know the phonetic symbols, the Phonetic input method is an input method with a low usage rate in the mainland and is mainly used in the Taiwan region. The Phonetic input method is the same as the Pinyin input method, as long as the pronunciation of the characters is known, the characters can be input. Compared with the Pinyin input method, the Phonetic input method has the advantage that it does not need to be input in the order of pronunciation, and since almost everyone in Taiwan understands the phonetic symbols, the difficulty of getting started is low. In addition, the disadvantage is the same as the pinyin input method, which is there are many homonyms. All in all, people who don't understand phonetic symbols are not recommended to use the phonetic input method. People who are interested and want to try to follow their heart and needs.</li>
