	<h3 id="QWERTY">QWERTY(1873)</h3>
	<p>QWERTY, (along with its direct derivatives QWERTZ and AZERTY), is the base keyboard layout which is most widely used. </p>

	<p><span>History</span>: QWERTY entered the market in 1874 was supposedly designed for typewriters to solve a very specific problem–to keep the types from jamming against each other. The most frequently used keys were placed apart from each other to prevent them from jamming.</p>

	<p><span>Cons</span>: Does not conform to the ergonomic layout.</p>

<div id="on">
On the basis of QWERTY, the following approaches have been developed from the point of view of efficiency, ergonomics and learning costs.</div>

<br/>

	<h3 id="DVORAK">DVORAK(1936)</h3>

	<p><span>Dvorak layout puts the majority of key strokes to the home row</span>, using about 60% of the finger motion required by QWERTY, which makes typing faster and more ergonomic.</p>

	<p><span>It puts vowels and the most used symbol characters are on the left, and the most used consonants are on the right.</span> Typing alternating between hands becomes more faster, and it could reduce error and fatigue.</p>

	<p><span>The Dvorak keyboard puts the more often used keys on the right hand side</span>, 56% of the typing done by the right hand, which is convenient for majority of people, while with QWERTY keyboards, more typing is done by the left hand. </p>

    <p><span>Cons</span>: Performance difference compared with QWERTY layout is not outstanding, the gain is too small compared to the costs of retraining.</p>

<br/>
<br/>


	<h3 id="COLEMAK">COLEMAK(2006)</h3>

	<p><span>Similar to the DVORAK</span>，it puts the majority of key strokes to the home row, paying attention to distribution of left hand and right hand load and so on.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, <span>it retains most of position non-alphabetic characters and keyboard shortcuts in QWERTY layout</span>, so the learning cost is low as many users have already accustomed to the QWERTY layout.</p>

	<p><span>Cons</span>: Fingers' Lateral movement is clumsy.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

	<h3 id="Workman">Workman(2010)</h3>	

	<p><span>Frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers</span>, it has low level of overall finger travel lateral movement of the fingers and wrists is reduced. Workman keyboard makes typing ergonomic, and efficient.</p>

	<p><span>It reduces load on the right pinky andbalances left-hand and right-hand usage</span> compared to DVORAK and COLEMAK.</p>

	<p><span>Cons</span>: 21 characters are different from QWERTY causes high learning cost. Left ring finger has slightly higher load compared to QWERTY, DVORAK, and COLEMAK.</p>
