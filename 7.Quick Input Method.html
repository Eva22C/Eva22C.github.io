	<hr/>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>The <span>Quick Input Method (速成輸入法)</span>, also known as the "Simplified Cangjie" or "Sucheng," it was developed as a simplified version of the Cangjie Input Method and designed to be easier to learn and use , especially for those who are not familiar with the intricate structure of Chinese characters. </p>

	<hr/>
	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
	<li>Quick Input Method simplifies the process of typing Chinese characters by using only the first and last Cangjie basic keystrokes of a character.</li>
	<li>It relies on the user's familiarity with character pronunciation and may offer multiple character options, based on the inputted code, which the user can then choose from.</li>
	<li>Like Cangjie, it supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters but is more commonly used for Traditional Chinese characters.</li>

	<hr/>
	<h2 id="usage method">Usage method</h2>
	<p>It retains the shape-based input concept but requires fewer keystrokes for faster input. In Quick input method, characters are divided into three types: single-element, dual-element, and multi-element.</p>
	<p>For single-element characters (e.g., "木"), type the corresponding key directly (here, "D"). For dual-element characters (e.g., "明"), type the first and last radicals (here, "AB"). For multi-element characters, type the first and last radicals (e.g., "靜" would be "QD"in quick input method but "QBBSD"in Cangjie input method).</p>
	<p>For examples: Let's type "都愛學習" using both Cangjie and Quick input methods:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>Cangjie</td>
		<td>Quick</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>都</td>
		<td><span>J</span>AN<span>L</span></td>
		<td>JL</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>愛</td>
		<td><span>B</span>BK<span>E</span></td>
		<td>BE</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>學</td>
		<td><span>H</span>BN<span>D</span></td>
		<td>HD</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>習</td>
		<td><span>S</span>YH<span>A</span></td>
		<td>SA</td>
	</tr>
</table>

	<p>To type a character, break it down into its radicals and type the corresponding keys. For instance, to input "明" (meaning bright), you would type "AB" since it consists of the radicals 日 (A) and 月 (B).</p>

	<h2 id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2>
	<p3>Advantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>High accuracy: Due to the unique code assigned to each character, the Cangjie Input Method offers high accuracy and reduces the likelihood of mistyping.</li>
		<li>Speed: Once users become proficient, they can type quickly and efficiently.</li>
		<li>Learning tool: Learning the Cangjie Input Method can help users better understand the structure and composition of Chinese characters.</li>
	</ol>
	<br/>

	<p3>Disadvantages</p3>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Steep learning curve: The Cangjie Input Method requires users to learn and memorize a significant number of codes, making it challenging for beginners.</li>
		<li>Limited use: Although it supports both Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, the Cangjie Input Method's primary user base is in regions that use Traditional Chinese characters, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong.</li>
